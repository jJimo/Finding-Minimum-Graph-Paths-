<b>Finding Minimum Graph Paths-Sigmod Contest Task of 2016</b>

Pregraduate team project at Software Development Class.
The goal was, given a workload of graph path and addition queries, to execute it efficiently. To so, various structures and indexes were created.

We had two classes of graphs, static and dynamic. We impemented different algorithms for each graph category(Stongly Connected Components, Tarjan Algorithm, Bidirectional Breadth-First-Search).

To reduce execution time, a thread-based approach with a Job Scheduler was implemented.
